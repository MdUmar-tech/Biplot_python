# Bidirectional Bar Plot in Python

## Overview
This Python script generates a bidirectional bar plot using matplotlib and pandas, displaying bars above and below the x-axis for comparison. It reshapes the data to create a mirror effect, where one group of bars is displayed above and the other below the x-axis. The script applies transformations to the data to achieve the desired visualization and utilizes the pandas library for data manipulation and matplotlib for plotting.

## Features
- Generates a bidirectional bar plot with bars above and below the x-axis for comparison.
- Reshapes the data to create a mirror effect, with one group of bars above and the other below the x-axis.
- Applies transformations to the data to achieve the desired visualization.
- Utilizes the pandas library for data manipulation and matplotlib for plotting.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries (pandas, matplotlib) installed.
2. Download or clone the Python script "Bidirectional_Bar_Plot.py" to your local machine.
3. Open the script in your preferred Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python IDE).
4. Run the script to generate the bidirectional bar plot.

## Example
Below is an example of how to use the script:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Insert the code from "Bidirectional_Bar_Plot.py" here
